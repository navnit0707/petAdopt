# Project Brief

Pet Adopt is a React-based web application that allows users to search for pets by name, breed, and location. The purpose of the project is to make it easy for people to adopt pets on the go without having to visit physical locations. Users can also view brief descriptions about the pets they are interested in adopting and make an informed decision. With Pet Adopt, finding your new best friend has never been easier."
